        <p class="uwhP">The Chicago Underwater Hockey Team is full of competitive individuals who love a crazy, niche sport. Since people don't grow up playing underwater hockey in gym class or at summer camps, recruiting new players can be difficult. It's oftentimes tough to convince someone to try a sport they've never heard of or seen. It's even more difficult to recruit players when you tell them that underwater hockey is played on the bottom of a pool and they need to hold their breath!</p>

            <hr class="solid">
        </div>
        <p class="uwhP">The Chicago Underwater Hockey Team is a not-for-profit organization, and they do not have the budget to build a professional website. A board member requested that our team provide UX/UI recommendations to help improve their website and recruiting efforts.</p>

            <hr class="solid">
        </div>
        <p class="uwhP">Our team conducted five user interviews, focusing on three groups:</p>
        <ul class="listFull">
            <li class="uwhList">UWH board members</li>
            <li class="uwhList">New players</li>
            <li class="uwhList">Potential players</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="uwhP">By interviewing a wide range of individuals, we were able to identify differing user needs. Although the website's primary purpose is for recruitment, new and current players also need resources to help them better understand the game and improve their skills.

                <p class="surveyP">The current underwater hockey website provided only <strong>three of the seven items</strong>. This lack of information frustrates potential players who are looking for information and they leave the site unsatisfied.</p>

            <hr class="solid">

        <p class="uwhP">Through user research, we identified three objectives for the Chicago Underwater Hockey site:</p>
        <ol  class="listFull">
            <li class="uwhList">Recruit new players who know little-to-nothing about the sport</li>
            <li class="uwhList">Provide new players easy-to-understand resources to help them improve their skills</li>
            <li class="uwhList">Offer veteran players advanced drills and workouts to take them to the next level</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="uwhP">Since the primary goal of the site is to aid recruitment efforts, we developed a user persona, Johanna, who represented our target audience.</p>

        <ul class="listFull">
            <li class="uwhList">We made design decisions, such as the Chicago star divider lines, that may be difficult to replicate if you don't have experience with coding or developing websites. Chicago Underwater Hockey would need to simplify some pages before implementing our designs.</li>
            <li class="uwhList">As currently designed, the schedule page would require a significant amount of time update and maintain. In retrospect, we could have simplified the design and included a monthly calendar with a PDF download option.</li>
