            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Beth Ann, a UX/UI specialist. I recently transitioned into this field after nearly eight years in the digital content world. As a Northwestern Medicine digital content specialist, I am currently leading the marianjoy.org content migration to nm.org. I've also redesigned four women's health microsites and restructured the gastroenterology section on nm.org.</p>

            <p>As I gained more experience in digital content, I recognized that my favorite projects were UX-oriented. I love digging into analytics, competitive analysis, and heat mapping to identify areas of opportunity for the service lines that I manage. I also perform extensive content audits—grouping content into blocks and organizing it into a site structure that satisfies both client and user needs.</p>
            
            <p>Because of my growing interest in UX work, I enrolled in Northwestern University's UX/UI Bootcamp and I graduated with a certificate in UX Design in August 2022. I'm excited to pursue this career path and to learn and grow as a UX specialist.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of work, I'm always on the go. Oftentimes, you can find me in a pool playing underwater hockey, training for my next marathon, teaching my dog, Franklin, new tricks, or starting a new renovation project on my 1912 farmhouse.</p>
